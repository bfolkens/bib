  abstract = "Computational intelligence techniques for financial trading systems have always been quite popular. In the last decade, deep learning models start getting more attention, especially within the image processing community. In this study, we propose a novel algorithmic trading model CNN-TA using a 2-D convolutional neural network based on image processing properties. In order to convert financial time series into 2-D images, 15 different technical indicators each with different parameter selections are utilized. Each indicator instance generates data for a 15 day period. As a result, 15 × 15 sized 2-D images are constructed. Each image is then labeled as Buy, Sell or Hold depending on the hills and valleys of the original time series. The results indicate that when compared with the Buy & Hold Strategy and other common trading systems over a long out-of-sample period, the trained model provides better results for stocks and ETFs."

  title={Dealing with the inventory risk: a solution to the market making problem},
  journal={Mathematics and Financial Economics},
  year={2013},
  volume={7},
  number={4},
  pages={477-507},
  abstract={Market makers continuously set bid and ask quotes for the stocks they have under consideration. Hence they face a complex optimization problem in which their return, based on the bid-ask spread they quote and the frequency at which they indeed provide liquidity, is challenged by the price risk they bear due to their inventory. In this paper, we consider a stochastic control problem similar to the one introduced by Ho and Stoll (J Fin Econ 9(1): 47-73, 1981) and formalized mathematically by Avellaneda and Stoikov (Quant Fin 8(3):217-224, 2008). The market is modeled using a reference price Stfollowing a Brownian motion with standard deviation s, arrival rates of buy or sell liquidity-consuming orders depend on the distance to the reference price Stand a market maker maximizes the expected utility of its P\&L over a finite time horizon. We show that the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated to the stochastic optimal control problem can be transformed into a system of linear ordinary differential equations and we solve the market making problem under inventory constraints. We also shed light on the asymptotic behavior of the optimal quotes and propose closed-form approximations based on a spectral characterization of the optimal quotes.},
